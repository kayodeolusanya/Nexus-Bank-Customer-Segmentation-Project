# Nexus-Bank-Customer-Segmentation-Project

Nexus Bank is a financial institution dedicated to
delivering unparalleled banking services to their clients. Their mission
is to establish enduring relationships with their customers by
providing tailored financial solutions that align with their individual
needs and goals.

Nexux bank has conducted campaigns with the goal of acquiring deposits.
In the last board meeting, the directors where unsatisfied with their current situation and
need to optimize the operations at Nexus bank.
The Director of Nexus Bank contacted me as a Data Scientist because they are interested in
leveraging the power of their data to gain insights into the bank and improve their
efficiency. They want to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior to decipher if
customer demographics such as age, educational level e.t.c influences customers attitude
toward defaulting. The board specifically wants to anticipate future customer behavior
and know the likelihood of deposits from customers.

Nexux wants to understand how effective their campaigns are and thus
develop marketing campaigns to reach specific customer segments. By analyzing
customer behaviors, loan trends, and marketing campaign effectiveness, Nexus wants to
optimize its operations, mitigate risks/ loan defaults, and improve customer deposits.
