## Nexus-Bank-Customer-Segmentation-Project
### Problem Statement
Nexus Bank is a financial institution dedicated to
delivering unparalleled banking services to their clients. Their mission
is to establish enduring relationships with their customers by
providing tailored financial solutions that align with their individual
needs and goals.

Nexux bank has conducted campaigns with the goal of acquiring deposits.
In the last board meeting, the directors where unsatisfied with their current situation and
need to optimize the operations at Nexus bank.
The Director of Nexus Bank contacted me as a Data Scientist because they are interested in
leveraging the power of their data to gain insights into the bank and improve their
efficiency. They want to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior to decipher if
customer demographics such as age, educational level e.t.c influences customers attitude
toward defaulting. The board specifically wants to anticipate future customer behavior
and know the likelihood of deposits from customers.

Nexus Bank wants to understand how effective their campaigns are and thus
develop marketing campaigns to reach specific customer segments. By analyzing
customer behaviors, loan trends, and marketing campaign effectiveness, Nexus wants to
optimize its operations, mitigate risks/ loan defaults, and improve customer deposits.

This analysis was carried out using Python.

### Insights

The highest number of customers are adults i.e between the age of 30 and 50

It can be noticed that May had the highest encounter with customers however while December had the least.

It was also noticed that over 70% of the customers have not acquired any loan and further analysis showed that even those with loans have very low default rate.

Those without housing loan have higher account balance in the bank which makes sense because mortgage would keep taking a portion of their earnings. 


It can be noticed that the major means of communication of campaigns was through a cell or a telephone.,

From the data provided,36,503 customers either have a secondary or tertiary education(80%).

Analysing account balance, it was noticed that those with blue collar and management jobs have higher account balance and those with housemaid jobs or students have lesser account balance. The inference is that this is dependent on how much you earn.

Looking into deposits, only 11.7% of customers have deposits in the bank and leaving 88% not having a deposit.

When it comes to market campaign, over 81% of the previous campaigns have unknown outcomes. 



### Recommendations
To increase deposits, interest rate can be increased to attract more funds to the bank, zero withdrawal rate can also be implemented via online or mobile banking.

The bank needs an aggressive customer marketing campaign to attract customer with secondary adn tertiary education who have white or blue collar jobs.

Social media platforms should be utilized, these are usually cheaper especially with organic engagement of posts and referrals. Then broadcast and Radio stations could be used as the age range of majority of the customers are adults, they are more inclined towards the TV stations and still listen to radio channels.


The bank needs to do more in regards to its data collection as alot of features have unknown values.
